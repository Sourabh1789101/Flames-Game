# Flames-Game
A Python implementation of the FLAMES game, a fun and interactive game that determines the relationship status between two individuals based on their names. This game follows a series of steps to eliminate common letters and uses the remaining count to determine whether the pair are friends, lovers, affectionate, married, enemies, or siblings.
